## Requirements
Should work natively on Unity versions >= 5.5.1f1, but will be compatible with most recent versions of Unity if packaged.

<a name = "Installation"></a>
## Installation
Simply importing all the assets into a new Unity project and opening the Main scene should suffice.

In Unity,

    Edit > Project Settings > Player > Resolution and Presentation > Orientation

will allow you to restrict the game to portrait only (for mobile devices).

If you're building the game for older devices, make sure

    Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings > Minimum API Level

agrees with your version of Android.
