		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Meducate is a fun and upcoming trivia game designed to help kids learn about<br>
		various health topics. The questions come in different sets, to allow for general<br>
		health education while opening the possibility to create questions targeted to<br>
		the individual child's health concerns.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		Studies have shown that presenting new information to children in the form of games<br>
		helps them to learn that information more easily and fosters an environment in which<br>
		they <i>WANT</i> to learn the information. We hope our game will help to reach this<br>
		audience and make it easier for parents and doctors to get their kids and patients<br>
		interested in and prepared to live a healtier life.</p>
